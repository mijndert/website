First of all, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I hope you found my content useful and even if you didn't, I'd love to hear what you think.

I have a few questions: Who are you? What are you up to? And how did you end up on my website? I would ask you these questions in person but I don't know how to contact you. I will never track anyone on this website.

This is an open invitation to send me [an email](mailto:hey@mijndert.dev), even to simply say hi. I'd love to hear from you.
