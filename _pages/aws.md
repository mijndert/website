In the old world you had to do extensive research into the right equipment that would hopefully meet all of your demands. Then you had to order the hardware, which would take another month, and then someone had to install and configure the equipment. Provisioning a bunch of servers would easily take a few months. **We're now building an entirely new class of infrastructure and democratizing them so anyone has access to them**.

Today, companies can provision their infrastructure in just a few minutes and scale the amount of resources up and down as demand fluctuates. In the meantime, you just pay for the resources that you actually use. This kind of flexibility **democratizes access to compute resources**  and allows anyone with the right idea to build it and scale to millions of users without spending a dime up-front.

That's where AWS comes in.

AWS is short for Amazon Web Services. **The world’s largest online book store also happens to run the world’s largest public cloud provider**. Back in 2006 AWS launched with just a handful over services. Today, AWS offers PaaS (platform as a service), IaaS (infrastructure as a service), serverless computing, and much more, with well over 200 different services and products.

In this guide I want to go through as many services as possible and (briefly) explain what the service is and how you can benefit from using it.
