If you're anything like me you probably love to talk about the tools that you use to do your work every day. This page serves as a living document of just that.

## Software

- [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) &mdash; Recently switched back to Terminal from iTerm2 since Tmux is all I need really. [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) as the color scheme and [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as the font.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) &mdash; You can find my [dotfiles](https://github.com/mijndert/dotfiles) right here.
- [NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/) &mdash; Simple, fast e-mail client. I use this one for quickly triaging incoming messages. Otherwise I'll use the default Apple Mail app.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) &mdash; Allows me to me switch between multiple programs and projects at once.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) &mdash; Vim is and always will be my favorite editor, though I must admit I fire up VS Code every once in a while as well.
- [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) &mdash; Great RSS reader.
- [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) &mdash; I use my laptop like a desktop, so nothing should ever sleep. This handy tool prevents that.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) &mdash; I try and run as much of the tools that I use on the command-line in containers for obvious reasons.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) &mdash; I use the AWS CLI for all sorts of work, mostly because I don't like clicking around in the web UI all the time.
- [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) &mdash; All infrastructure as code goes here
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) &mdash; When CloudFormation doesn't quite cut it. 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) &mdash; I'm a heavy user of Git and GitHub for storing my infrastructure as code projects.
- [1Password](https://1password.com) &mdash; 1Password really is a life saver. I couldn't possibly live without it.
- [Slack](https://slackhq.com) &mdash; I work remote all the time, either at home or at clients. Slack makes it possible to stay in touch with colleagues.

## Hardware

- [16" MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac/) &mdash; I'm currently using the 2019 model with a 6-core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.
- [LG 27UK850](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK850-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor) &mdash; After using a Dell Ultrasharp 1440p panel for the longest time I've switched to this LG one. It's 4K and it has USB-C connections making it future-proof for now.
- [iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11/) &mdash; This is again the best iPhone Apple has ever made. I love the camera and the huge screen, though I understand it's not for everybody.
- [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/nl-nl/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html): Finally replaced my aging M570 trackball with this new one.
- [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2-silver) &mdash; In terms of ergonomics this isn't the best mouse so I switch to the trackpad or trackball regulary to prevent RSI. I love this mouse because it's very portable and has touch input.
- [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) &mdash; Hands down the best keyboard ever made. I'm using the small version without the numpad because it fits in my bag. Portability is important to me.
- [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) &mdash; Awesome pair of headphones to block out the noise caused by open-office plans I often find myself in.
