If you're anything like me you probably love to talk about the tools that you use to do your work every day. This page serves as a living document of the things I use every day.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/): a super fast, customizable web browser. I use it every single day on all my devices.
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com): I work in the terminal 80% of the time, why not pick the best terminal app?
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): I replaced Atom with VS Code recently and couldn't be happier. It's fast, has a bunch of cool plug-ins and gets new features on a regular basis.
- [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): I use my laptop like a desktop, so nothing should ever sleep. This handy tool prevents that.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): I try and run as much of the tools that I use on the command-line in containers for obvious reasons.
- [SSHuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle): forwards my network traffic over a secure SSH tunnel to protect my privacy.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): I use the AWS CLI for all sorts of work, mostly because I don't like clicking around in the web UI all the time.
- [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/): CloudFormation isn't perfect so I'm looking at AWS CDK more and more. 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): I'm a heavy user of Git and GitHub for storing my infrastructure as code projects.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): the only todo app that actually looks good on Mac and iOS.
- [1Password](https://1password.com): 1Password really is a life saver. I couldn't possibly live without it.
- [Slack](https://slackhq.com): I work remote all the time, either at home or at clients. Slack makes it possible to stay in touch with colleagues.
