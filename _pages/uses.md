If you're anything like me you probably love to talk about the tools that you use to do your work every day. This page serves as a living document of the things I use every day.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Desktop apps

I use a lot of apps throughout the day but these are the ones I use the most.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/): a super fast, customizable web browser. I use it every single day on all my devices.
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com): I work in the terminal 80% of the time, why not pick the best terminal app?
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): I replaced Atom with VS Code recently and couldn't be happier. It's fast, has a bunch of cool plug-ins and gets new features on a regular basis.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org): whenever I need to do some quick edits I usually pick Vim.
- [Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): I use my laptop like a desktop, so nothing should ever sleep. This handy tool prevents that.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): I try and run as much of the tools that I use on the command-line in containers for obvious reasons.
- [SSHuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle): forwards my network traffic over a secure SSH tunnel.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): I use the AWS CLI for all sorts of work, mostly because I don't like clicking around in the web UI all the time.
- [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/): not sure if it's still the best Twitter desktop client, but it's what I'm used to and it syncs nicely with my iOS devices.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/): the only todo app that actually looks good on Mac and iOS.
- [1Password](https://1password.com): 1Password really is a life saver. I couldn't possibly live without it.
- [Slack](https://slackhq.com): work related stuff goes here.
- [Reflex](https://stuntsoftware.com/reflex/): prevents macOS from hijacking the media keys.
- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com): I'm a heavy user of MarkDown and the split view feature is a life saver.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Hardware

In terms of hardware I try to maintain a fairly simple setup. I don't have too much stuff because otherwise everything gets outdated really quickly.

- LG 27UK850: a beautiful 27 inch 4K screen that also supports HDR content and includes a USB-C connection that will also charge my 2018 MacBook Pro.
- MacBook Pro 15" (2015): this is a laptop from work. It has an Intel i7, 16GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card and that's more power than I'll ever need. It's like having a very thin, good looking, supercomputer that I can carry with me.
- MacBook Pro 15" (2018): this is our family computer, with some overkill specs like a 6-core i7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a Radeon Pro 650X. This machine is used for gaming, side-projects, and everything else not related to work.
- iPhone 11: the best camera in any smartphone. I ditched my iPad because the screen is more than sufficient for my more mobile needs.
- Magic Mouse 2: it's not the best mouse in terms of ergonomics but it's easy to carry around. I switch from the trackpad to the Magic Mouse regularly in order to prevent RSI.
- Magic Keyboard: this might be controversial but I honestly think this is the greatest keyboard ever produced.
- AirPods Pro: I recently replaced my original AirPods with the Pro version. They help me focus in the loud open-office plans which I often find myself in.
- Apple Watch Series 3: this is another one of those "I didn't know I needed it until I tried" products. My Apple Watch is now an important part of my life, keeping me healthy by daily reminders to stand/walk more and drink more water.
- [Sonos Beam](https://www.sonos.com/nl-nl/shop/beam.html) and [Sonos One](https://www.sonos.com/nl-nl/shop/one.html): Music around the house, speaks for itself. I do however always want to buy more Sonos stuff.
