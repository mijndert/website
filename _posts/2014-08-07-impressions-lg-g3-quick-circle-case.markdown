<p>Some quick things I want to share about the LG G3 and the Quick Circle case.</p>

<p>Having used my Nexus 4 for about 18 months the LG G3 feels HUGE at first. The thin bezels are amazing and it's really the eye catcher of this phone. I've now been using the LG G3 for about a month and I can honestly say, this is the best phone I've ever had.</p>

<p>There's a lot of complaints about battery life and the size of the phone. Both are not an issue, at least for people with average-large size hands. The stand-by time on the G3 absolutely crushes the competition and everything just feels really snappy. Yes, I experienced some lag with the stock launcher but changing to ART solved that issue.</p>

<p>When you first boot the phone there's some bloatware on my EU model but it wasn't too bad. The only really annoying thing I couldn't remove or disable was McAfee. The only solution there is to disable its device administration role. All other bloatware is easily disabled, hidden or even removed.</p>

<p>I think LG did a really great job at keeping true to stock Android while adding a lot of great features and handy UX tricks with the launcher.</p>

<p>The Quick Circle case I got for free is a really nice addition. The EU model has wireless charging built-in to the standard backplate, the US model doesn't seem to have that feature so they need the Quick Circle case to wirelessly charge their phones. I don't know if I'll keep using the case, though. There's already some build up of dust around the edges and it doesn't feel right when you flip the cover to the back when calling. But for anyone who want to give their LG G3 a bit more protection this is the case to get, at least for now.</p>
