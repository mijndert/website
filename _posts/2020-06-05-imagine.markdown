I'm a white male living in Europe. I can't possibly begin to imagine what it's like to be black. 

What I can do however, is try to imagine what it does to a person to live in constant fear of not making it home.

Imagine what it's like to be turned away from schools, internships, jobs.

Imagine what it's like to be framed.

Imagine what it's like to be shot at while you're driving your pregnant wife to the hospital.

Imagine what it's like to have to put up a fight for your dignity every single day.

Imagine what it's like to have your basic human rights stripped away piece by piece.

Step back.

Take a minute.

Put yourself in those shoes.

Imagine.
