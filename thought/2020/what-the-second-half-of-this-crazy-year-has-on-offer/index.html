The COVID-19 crisis has thrown most plans out the window, but also opened doors to previously unexplored terrain. I&rsquo;ve been working from home for most of the year and the new normal is just now settling in a bit.</p><p>Working from home has mostly blurred the lines between work and private life, which made me reconsider what&rsquo;s really important, just to keep myself and my loved ones sane. I&rsquo;ve all but thrown my Apple Watch out to be <em>in the moment</em> more. I&rsquo;ve disabled most notifications on my iPhone because they gave me anxiety.</p><p>All of these little changes add up to being more aware of my surroundings, putting my energy where it&rsquo;s most needed right now: real connections with the people I love.</p><p>The biggest thing that&rsquo;s happening in the second half of this year, or ever, is becoming a dad for the first time. We&rsquo;ve been phenomenaly lucky to even get to this point and I want to be the best dad I can possibly be. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m slowly throwing out distractions like my Apple Watch and notifications. I want to be there for every little moment, for each interaction and each step of the way. In the second half of this year and beyond I will be <em>offline</em> more and putting real life experiences over anything else.</p><p>With a kid coming up it feels like not much else matters. I&rsquo;m both anxious to meet her and already in love.</p><p>So far, 2020 sucked in a lot of ways, but it&rsquo;s also a year of tremendous change and happiness.</p></article><style>@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F63fjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n1iEq131nj-otFQ.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+100-24F,U+259,U+1E??,U+2020,U+20A0-20AB,U+20AD-20CF,U+2113,U+2C60-2C7F,U+A720-A7FF}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F63fjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n1i8q131nj-o.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+??,U+131,U+152-153,U+2BB-2BC,U+2C6,U+2DA,U+2DC,U+2000-206F,U+2074,U+20AC,U+2122,U+2191,U+2193,U+2212,U+2215,U+FEFF,U+FFFD}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F6qfjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n3pQPwl5FgsAXHNlYzg.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+100-24F,U+259,U+1E??,U+2020,U+20A0-20AB,U+20AD-20CF,U+2113,U+2C60-2C7F,U+A720-A7FF}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F6qfjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n3pQPwlBFgsAXHNk.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+??,U+131,U+152-153,U+2BB-2BC,U+2C6,U+2DA,U+2DC,U+2000-206F,U+2074,U+20AC,U+2122,U+2191,U+2193,U+2212,U+2215,U+FEFF,U+FFFD}</style></body></html>
