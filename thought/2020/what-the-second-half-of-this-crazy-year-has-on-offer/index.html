The COVID-19 crisis has thrown most plans out the window, but also opened doors to previously unexplored terrain. I&rsquo;ve been working from home for most of the year and the new normal is just now settling in a bit.</p><p>Working from home has mostly blurred the lines between work and private life, which made me reconsider what&rsquo;s really important, just to keep myself and my loved ones sane. I&rsquo;ve all but thrown my Apple Watch out to be <em>in the moment</em> more. I&rsquo;ve disabled most notifications on my iPhone because they gave me anxiety.</p><p>All of these little changes add up to being more aware of my surroundings, putting my energy where it&rsquo;s most needed right now: real connections with the people I love.</p><p>The biggest thing that&rsquo;s happening in the second half of this year, or ever, is becoming a dad for the first time. We&rsquo;ve been phenomenaly lucky to even get to this point and I want to be the best dad I can possibly be. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m slowly throwing out distractions like my Apple Watch and notifications. I want to be there for every little moment, for each interaction and each step of the way. In the second half of this year and beyond I will be <em>offline</em> more and putting real life experiences over anything else.</p><p>With a kid coming up it feels like not much else matters. I&rsquo;m both anxious to meet her and already in love.</p><p>So far, 2020 sucked in a lot of ways, but it&rsquo;s also a year of tremendous change and happiness.</p></article></body></html>
