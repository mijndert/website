Companies like Samsung make tv&rsquo;s so cheap, you have to be the product one way or the other. We have a Sony set running Android so it&rsquo;s bound to send data back too - it&rsquo;s in the nature of the software it&rsquo;s running. Even if we&rsquo;re not using the built-in OS it will know when I&rsquo;ve selected the HDMI input for my Xbox, I&rsquo;m sure.</p><p>Apparently Vizio, a brand that&rsquo;s not as popular in Europe as it is in the US, is even worse at it.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-cards=hidden data-lang=nl><p lang=en dir=ltr>My parentsâ€™ brand new Vizio P-Series TV (which is not set up to stream anything, they have an Apple TV) pings a server 10x more than any other device they own <a href=https://t.co/C7BHyFmzAh>pic.twitter.com/C7BHyFmzAh</a></p>&mdash; nilay patel (@reckless) <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1081787683515490305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">6 januari 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>I&rsquo;ve long campaigned for dumb tv&rsquo;s - a big screen with a bunch of HDMI inputs and nothing else. I can connect my own devices thank you very much. Yet companies refuse because it seems like they are forced to monetize their devices beyond the initial sale.</p><p>The biggest problem with modern so-called smart tv&rsquo;s however is the fact that the manufacturer stops updating the software after one maybe two years. Even our relatively new tv doesn&rsquo;t get the latest Android updates anymore, depriving the device of essential security patches.</p><p>Modern tv&rsquo;s are fucked and the biggest risk to your home network. I would gladly pay a premium for a big 4K HDR screen with 6 HDMI inputs and nothing else. A true dumb tv to counteract the world we live in where everything has an IP address.</p><p>It&rsquo;s time these companies start listening to their customers instead of their shareholders.</p><p>Consider this your reminder to disconnect your tv from your network.</p></article><section class=footer><p>The opinions on this site are my own.
