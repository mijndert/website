That&rsquo;s almost a full year of working remotely and being fully in charge of my own productivity. To be honest, I could keep this going forever - I&rsquo;ve never been more productive in my life.</p><p>The last few months have also been perfect to optimize certain aspects of my work, the most important one being information processing. I&rsquo;ve been horrible at keeping track of todo items before since I could never make it stick. Due to WFH I had the time to create a system for myself and I&rsquo;ve never been more productive, stress-free and happy.</p><p>My system hinges on categorizing all of my information into 4 silo&rsquo;s: articles, todo items, quick notes and knowledge. Let&rsquo;s go through them one by one.</p><h2 id=articles>Articles</h2><p>One of the websites I visit (almost) daily is <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/>Hacker News</a>. Before, I would open a bunch of links and have something like 10 tabs open until I got around to reading the articles. In practice this meant I&rsquo;d probably read 2 and skim through the rest. I always hated myself for it because I know a lot of these articles would&rsquo;ve added a lot of value to my life.</p><p>Over a year ago my wife gifted me a <a href=https://gl.kobobooks.com/collections/all>Kobo e-reader</a> which has the ability to connect to a <a href=https://getpocket.com/>Pocket</a> account. Firefox has built-in support for saving articles to Pocket as well, no extensions required. Now, instead of opening 10 articles in tabs and keeping them open for a few days, I save everything I want to read to Pocket which then automatically <a href=https://help.getpocket.com/article/1006-getting-started-with-kobo>syncs to my Kobo</a>. There&rsquo;s absolutely no manual action required which I like a lot. Of course, an e-ink display is a much more enjoyable way of reading long-form articles than the LCD screen of my laptop or phone.</p><p>It&rsquo;s nothing novel but this simple action enriches my life with new insights I glean from all of the artices my Kobo safeguards for me.</p><h2 id=todo-items>Todo items</h2><p>Many years ago I subscribed to the idea of <a href=https://gettingthingsdone.com/>Getting Things Done</a>, but only a subset of the concept ever stuck with me. I think GTD is way too complicated for a single person with a limited amount of todo items at any given time. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been trying just about every todo application, but one that always appealed to me was <a href=https://culturedcode.com/things/>Things</a>.</p><p>Things is only as powerful as you want it to be since it has <a href=https://culturedcode.com/things/guide/>many features</a> I never really used before: headings, tags, sub-items, etcetera. I basically used Things as a glorified list of todo&rsquo;s without any context apart from projects.</p><p>Things deserves its own blog post because I can talk for hours about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oBuOrrBskw">many ways</a> you can process information inside the app. I&rsquo;ll tell you about the most important things I do inside of Things so I&rsquo;ll, hopefully, never forget something again.</p><ul><li>I added an <a href=https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803567/>iOS widget</a> that points to my Inbox to make adding a new task as easy as possible</li><li>I created new areas to categorize projects under and added emoji in the title of the area for easier visual grepping</li><li>Each project now has a description in the notes field that outlines my goals</li><li>I&rsquo;ve added a recurring task for a daily review to have a look at any new tasks from the Inbox and add new tasks I want to work on to Today</li><li>I started <a href=https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803581/>adding Tags</a> to todo items to easily filter on priority and assumed effort</li></ul><h2 id=quick-notes>Quick notes</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with digital note taking tools and I&rsquo;ve again tried most of them. At the end of the day I want the least amount of friction between my thoughts and putting them in writing for later reference. I also like it when a tool feels a well crafted Mac app instead of some janky web app. That&rsquo;s why I always found apps like <a href=https://bear.app/>Bear</a> to be very cumbersome. Since I&rsquo;m already knees deep in the Apple ecosystem I&rsquo;m currently using the default <a href=https://www.icloud.com/notes>Apple Notes</a> app across my devices.</p><p>Since WFH I have a lot of meetings with all of my different clients. During those meetings I make quick notes of everything we talk about. Right after the meeting I review my notes and distill everything into action items which I jot down in Things. After that the note basically becomes useless again as the information is processed.</p><h2 id=knowledge>Knowledge</h2><p>You&rsquo;ve probably found yourself Googling a Git command or something about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>regex</a> more than once. I&rsquo;ve been there, doesn&rsquo;t feel great.</p><p>Recently I got into the concept of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8">Second Brain</a>, Digital Brain or whatever you wanna call it. It&rsquo;s a collection of, in my case, Markdown files with stuff I want to keep around for future reference. Notes that I want to keep around for a short period of time are in Notes, my Digital Brain is for keeping knowledge around that will prove its worth over time.</p><p>The tool I&rsquo;ve chosen to create my Digital Brain is <a href=https://obsidian.md/>Obsidian</a>, but there are of course others as well like <a href=https://roamresearch.com/>Roam Research</a>. The latter is way too complicated for my taste as I just to have a bunch of Markdown files and I want to link certain pages together to create a cortex of sorts.</p><p>At first it&rsquo;s quite time consuming to jot down every little piece of knowledge I can think of. But in the end I hope it&rsquo;ll lessen the amount of Google searches for trivial stuff. Obsidian allows me to very quickly search the contents of my Digital Brain so that&rsquo;s awesome as well.</p><p>Another reason I&rsquo;m building this is because I want to have this as my part of my legacy - a small window into what it was like when I was alive. I hope it&rsquo;s going to be one of those <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule>time capsules</a> they put in the ground to be recovered a hundred years from now.</p></article><style>@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F63fjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n1iEq131nj-otFQ.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+100-24F,U+259,U+1E??,U+2020,U+20A0-20AB,U+20AD-20CF,U+2113,U+2C60-2C7F,U+A720-A7FF}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F63fjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n1i8q131nj-o.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+??,U+131,U+152-153,U+2BB-2BC,U+2C6,U+2DA,U+2DC,U+2000-206F,U+2074,U+20AC,U+2122,U+2191,U+2193,U+2212,U+2215,U+FEFF,U+FFFD}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F6qfjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n3pQPwl5FgsAXHNlYzg.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+100-24F,U+259,U+1E??,U+2020,U+20A0-20AB,U+20AD-20CF,U+2113,U+2C60-2C7F,U+A720-A7FF}@font-face{font-family:ibm plex mono;font-style:normal;font-weight:700;font-display:swap;src:url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/ibmplexmono/v6/-F6qfjptAgt5VM-kVkqdyU8n3pQPwlBFgsAXHNk.woff2)format('woff2');unicode-range:U+??,U+131,U+152-153,U+2BB-2BC,U+2C6,U+2DA,U+2DC,U+2000-206F,U+2074,U+20AC,U+2122,U+2191,U+2193,U+2212,U+2215,U+FEFF,U+FFFD}</style></body></html>
