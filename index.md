I'm a hacker, engineer and minimalist. 

I focus mainly on building large distributed systems and CI/CD. I bring 10+ years of experience with AWS and Linux to the table and I love sharing my knowledge with others.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mijndert). All sorts of open source code is stored over at [GitHub](https://github.com/mijndert). Stuff that doesn't quite fit in a tweet irregulary finds its way to my [blog](/blog/).

VÃ¤lkommen.
