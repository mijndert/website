Hi, my name is Mijndert. I'm a hacker, engineer and minimalist. 

I'm currently working for [inQdo](https://inqdo.com/) as a consulting AWS engineer and I focus mainly on DevOps. I like building large distributed systems for high-performance computing. I believe in infrastructure as code, my mantra is _"if it's not in code, it doesn't exist"_.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mijndert). All sorts of open source code is stored over at [GitHub](https://github.com/mijndert). Stuff that doesn't quite fit in a tweet irregulary finds its way to my [blog](/blog/). Other means on contacting me can be found [right here](/more/contact/).

VÃ¤lkommen.
